# Credit card fraud detection using machine learning

Our goal was to create an application that could detect money-related crimes using machine learning. According to the idea, our project was supposed to involve software development, work with data science, the use of machine learning and bring novelty. The project aims to provide a solution to the problem of detecting suspicious activity in credit card transactions to prevent fraud and protect users.
Our project contains the code and resources needed to create and train a credit card fraud detection model. To implement this idea, we used Python as the main programming language, Jupiter Notebook for prototyping and Streamlite for visualization. A large number of libraries were also used to work with data, such as numpy, pandas, seaborn and others.


The project uses a free set of data from free access, which includes a collection of credit card transactions, both legitimate and fraudulent. The data set serves as the basis for training and evaluating the fraud detection model.
	We took the data set from the website kaggle.com. This site is an online resource and community for data science, machine learning and data research specialists.
